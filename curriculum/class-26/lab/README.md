# LAB - Application State

In this lab, you will be writing an application that manages an application state.

## Requirements

Your task for this lab will be to implement a Redux store which contains a list of items or products that you can add to a group or cart.

### Sample Implementation

You can find an example of a possible solution to this lab here:

[Sample Lab](https://js401n14-lab26.netlify.com/)

Note that this example is just for your reference, **your final lab does not need to match this example exactly**. A few things to note from this implementation:

-   The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework is used for styling, along with some custom Sass
-   This project has the `App` component, as well as the following structure:
    -   `store.js` contains the redux store and reducer
    -   `Header` is a component that keeps track of the party size
    -   `Search` allows you to search for new members for your party
    -   `Party` shows your party in more detail
-   `node-fetch` is used to make requests to the API endpoints

### Use CodeSandbox

For this React lab, you will be required to work in a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) project, instead of local code uploaded to Git. The reason for this is so that we can grade your work easier!

You can find instructions for how to create a CodeSandbox project in the class 18 [README](../../class-18/README.md#CodeSandbox).

### Must-Haves

For these front-end assignments, there is a lot more room for creativity and exploration. Typically, there will be a provided sample implementation that you can use for reference / inspiration. You do not have to duplicate this sample implementation; instead there are always a few key requirements that your application **must have** to get full points. Here are the must-haves for this lab:

-   You must implement a redux store used to save all state variables throughout your application
-   You must implement a reducer that implements logic on how to move from action to your new state
-   You must have at least one action that is a function, using the `thunk` middleware
-   You must have three major pieces to your application
    -   A page which allows you to browse all items and add/remove items from your collection
    -   A page will shows your collection in more detail
    -   A header component which on all pages shows the count of items in your collection

### Commenting

You are required to comment each class and function using proper [JSDoc comments](https://devhints.io/jsdoc).

### Tests

This lab will be graded for test coverage (80% is what to shoot for). You should not implement any snapshot tests. Instead, implement mount (shallow, full or render) tests using Enzyme. Here are some ideas of what you might want to test for:

-   Adding items to your collection
-   Removing items from your collection
-   Browse page loads correctly
-   Collection page loads correctly
-   State updates as expected

### Deployment

Deploy your CodeSandbox application to Netlify (CodeSandbox has that built in!)

## Assignment Submission Instructions

As usual, you will be required to have a `README.md` that you submit, containing a link to your CodeSandbox, deployed website, and UML Diagram.

Create a new repository for this lab. [Connect this repository to your CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/git), and connect your repository to Travis as in your backend labs.

### Configure your repository

Configure your folder with the following files and directories.

-   `README.md` - contains your lab documentation ([template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401n14/blob/master/reference/submission-instructions/labs/README-template.md))
-   `.gitignore` - contains a robust .gitignore file ([template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401n14/blob/master/configs/.gitignore))
-   `.travis.yml` - contains default travis configuration ([template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401n14/blob/master/configs/.travis.yml))
    -   Note: React has a built-in linter, and so for react labs you do not need to have ESLint or any ESLint configuration files. Also, be sure to remove the `npm run lint` command from your `.travis.yml`
-   `package.json` - contains `npm` package config and scripts

### Submit to Canvas

-   Ensure that your `README.md` exists and has:
    -   A link to your CodeSandbox
    -   A link to your deployed site
    -   Instructions for how to operate your application
        -   Please be clear and descriptive
        -   If parts of your application are broken, use this section of your README to describe how to run the working code so you can get partial points
    -   Embedded UML diagram image

**Be sure to delete any placeholder content if you use `README-template.md`.**

Once you've ensured your `README.md` is correct, within Canvas submit a link to your `README.md`

### Resubmitting

In order to resubmit, you can add another submission on the Canvas assignment with the same link to your `README.md`. Optionally, add a comment on your submission describing what changed in your resubmit.

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria                                                          | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Features: Score based on % of features demonstrably completed     | 2      |
| Code Implementation: Efficiency of code + Comments + Code Quality | 2      |
| Style: Components are styled in a pleasing way with custom Sass   | 2      |
| Testing: 0 for no tests, full points for 80% coverage             | 2      |
| Deployment to Netlify                                             | 1      |
| Documentation: README + UML + Links                               | 1      |
