# 401 Lightning Talks and White-boarding

## Lightning Talks

Lightning Talks are a great way for you to practice your presentation and speaking skills! When you learn something new and then turn that knowledge into a teachable presentation, you have a stronger understanding of the topic as well.

Also, if you sign up for a lightning talk, you can receive up to 10 extra credit points. That's a whole lab grade!

Take a look at the possible lightning talk topics below, as well as the associated date for presentation. Sign up for a slot by slack messaging your instructor with the name of the topic you would like to present. On the day of that lightning talk, you will have 15 minutes to teach that topic to the class in any way you like. Use presentations, code samples, white-boarding, or some other method to help the class understand. After your talk, your classmates will fill out a feedback form letting you know how you did, so that you can improve in the future!

Each student can max do 2 lightning talks.

## White-boarding

As you may know, your final "test" will be a white-boarding interview. In order to prep for that, every Saturday we will spend 20 minutes with one student working through a white-boarding interview question in front of the class. This is opt-in for now, so if you sign up you can receive up to 10 points extra credit towards your lab grades. That's a whole lab grade!

Each student can sign up for a max of 2 white-boarding interviews. If you would like to sign up for a Saturday, send me a message via Slack.
