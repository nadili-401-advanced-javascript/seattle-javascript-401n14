# Interview 02

Sanitize spaces in a URL.

## Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully. 
- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate a code challenge
- Score the candidate according to the [Whiteboard Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw){:target="_blank"}
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate

## Feature Tasks

- Actual code is required for a complete answer  
- Ask the candidate to write a function to sanitize a url, by encoding all spaces (an illegal character) into `%20`, the hexidecimal value for a space, in the ISO-Latin character set. 
- Avoid utilizing any built-in string-replace methods available in your language.
- This problem can be solved using different approaches:
  - Whatever the candidate comes up with, have them analyze the Big O, time and space. 

## Structure 

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview. 

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available. 

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to test their solution with different inputs to verify correctness.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill. 

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.

## Example

| Input | Output |
|-----|----| 
| `"http://code.org/hour of code.html"` | `"http://code.org/hour%20of%20code.html"` |

## Documentation

Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.
