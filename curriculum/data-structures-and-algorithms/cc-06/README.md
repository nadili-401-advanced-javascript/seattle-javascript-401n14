# Code Challenge 06

In this code challenge, you will be adding alternative insertion operations to a linked list.

## Specifications

-   Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
-   Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level `README.md`.
    -   Your top-level readme should contain a "Table of Contents" navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don't forget to update it!)
-   Create a new branch in your repo called `ll-insertions`.
-   Place this code challenge implementation in a `Data-Structures` folder within your repository.
-   On your branch, extend your `LinkedList` class from Code Challenge 05 (you can copy-paste the code from cc-05)
-   Include any configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
    -   _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Feature Tasks

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

-   `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list
    -   Hint: We did this in `cc-05/demos/linked-lists`
-   `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately before the first `value` node
-   `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately after the first `value` node

## Examples

#### `.append(value)`

| Input                               | Args | Output                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | :--: | ------------------------------------------ |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `D`  | `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> [D] -> null` |
| `head -> null`                      | `D`  | `head -> [D] -> null`                      |

#### `.insertBefore(value, newVal)`

| Input                               |  Args  | Output                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | :----: | ------------------------------------------ |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `B, D` | `head -> [A] -> [D] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `A, D` | `head -> [D] -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `C, D` | `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [D] -> [C] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `F, D` | `Error`                                    |

#### `.insertAfter(value, newVal)`

| Input                               |  Args  | Output                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | :----: | ------------------------------------------ |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `B, D` | `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [D] -> [C] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `A, D` | `head -> [A] -> [D] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `C, D` | `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> [D] -> null` |
| `head -> [A] -> [B] -> [C] -> null` | `F, D` | `Error`                                    |

## Features

-   Have a class named `Node`. This class should contain:
    -   A variable to hold data (i.e. `this.data`)
    -   A variable to hold the next `Node` object (i.e. `this.next`)
-   Have a class named `LinkedList`. This class should contain:
    -   A variable named `head` which holds the `Node` object that starts the list
    -   A constructor that instantiates `head` as an empty linked list
    -   A function called `insert` which takes in a value. This function will then create a new `Node` object, sets the object's `data` property equal to the value. The function then appends this new `Node` object to the beginning of the linked list (i.e. it sets a new `head`)
    -   A function called `includes` which takes in a value and returns a boolean if that value exists in the linked list
    -   A function called `toString` whcih takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list
    -   A function called `append` which adds a Node to the end of the list
    -   A function called `insertBefore` which adds a Node before a certain Node in the list
    -   A function called `insertAfter` which adds a Node after a certain Node in the list
-   Implement good error checking throughout your code. Create custom errors that describe what went wrong.

## Structure and Testing

Any functions you write should be clean, reusable and independent component parts to the whole program.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located in the middle of a linked list
4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
