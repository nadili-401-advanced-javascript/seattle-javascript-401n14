## Feature Tasks

Ask the Candidate the following question:

You are working with a file structure with only at most 2 files or folder. Each file directory has either one or two folders/files. 

Comparing two file different file directories, create a method that takes in 2 directory structures and compares both and determines whether or not they have the same number of individual files.

## Structure 

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview. 

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available. 

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to test their solution with different inputs to verify correctness.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill. 

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.


## Documentation

Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.
