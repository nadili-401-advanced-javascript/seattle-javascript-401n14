# Reading: Linked Lists

**For your assignment, go through these resources, and create a wiki entry in your fork of the class repo that summarizes the principle topic as though you were presenting the material to a 301 level student.**

Wiki Entry Ideas:

-   Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
-   Dictionary / Flash Cards
-   Notes in outline form
